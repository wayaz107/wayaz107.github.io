    The requirement of this project was to create an app with models that have at least one *has_many*, *belongs_to*, and *has_many :through* relationships. We also had to include nested routes, validations, scope method, and for users to be able to login, signup and also use a third party login(Facebook, google, etc.).

   The hardest part for me was planning out the project and figuring out the relationships between each model. That took me a long time to figure out and in the end I chose to include five models: User, Restaurant, Reviews, City, and Cuisine.My restaurant app allows users to be able to leave reviews on restaurants and see other users reviews and filter the restaurant by cuisine, and city. I also built two scope methods, one that shows the top rated restaurants and the other shows popular restaurants. 
	 
	 This project by far was the hardest for me. It had more requirements and we had to deal with nested routes, omniauth, strong params and figuring out how the models work with each other. I found Sinatra much easier and simpler. Rails is harder but doing this project helped deepen my understanding of Rails.
	 
	 
  I feel proud to have completed this project, and learned so much during the process. Looking forward to learning JavaScript.
