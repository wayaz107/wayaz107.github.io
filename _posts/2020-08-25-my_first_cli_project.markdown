  I will say that when I first approached this project, I was scared because I didn’t know where to start. The thought of building something from scratch was intimidating especially to a newbie to the field of coding. But like coding, I just had to take it step by step. When deciding between the API or scraping method, scrapping appealed to me more because it offered more flexibility on what I could choose and allow me the freedom of the content and website I wanted to cover.

  I wanted my project to list all the beautiful national parks in Wisconsin because, having lived here for the past year, I discovered how beautiful it is. I chose National Park service’s website to scrape my data. The hardest part for me was scraping and trying to understand how I can use the data I collect to display it to the users. After many hours of persistent effort and troubleshooting, I was finally able to complete my very first CLI project! It lists the four national parks in Wisconsin and user can select the park they want more information on. The user can view address and directions to the park they selected. Building this project wasn't easy, but I am so happy that I have come this far and build something on my own and now looking forward to the next project!
